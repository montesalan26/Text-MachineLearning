# Text-MachineLearning
This project was created on Jupyter Notebook. In this project, we took a dataset composed of Movies created with their positive and negative reviews. Taking the reviews and vectorizing them, turning into a numerical representation and transforming them to features to train different machine learning models. Some of the Machine Learning models used are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier. We used the F1 Score to evaluate the machine learning models.
